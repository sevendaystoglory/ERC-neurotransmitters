Today morning, Juan woke up with a severe backpain. He is not in a very good mood, but still manages to keep up. He gets up from his bag. Packs up his things and is ready for the day ahead. He gets a call from his home in about the sickness of his grandma. He is disheartened. He called his grandma immediately. She loves icecream.
